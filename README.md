<u><h2>The mouse is the one of the wonderfull inventions of the Human Computer Interaction(HCI) Technology.</h2></u>
<h4>-> Currently we are using wired or may be wireless mouses.</h3>
<h4>-> But in real time cases some computers may not support for a physical mouse, some users may be dealth with some disability.</h3>
<h4>-> So this Hand controlled AI Virtual Mouse can be used to overcome this problem.</h3>
<h4>-> Making a user to control the mouse by reducing the computer human interaction.</h3>

<h2>FUNCTIONALITIES:</h2>
<h4>This project provides a hands-free alternative for computer interaction. </h4>
<h4>The virtual mouse supports various functionalities such as 
  <h4>>‚û°Ô∏è scrolling</h4>
  <h4>>‚û°Ô∏è left and right-clicking </h4>
  <h4>>‚û°Ô∏è hovering</h4>
  <h4>>‚û°Ô∏è drag-and-drop.</h4>
  <h4>>‚û°Ô∏è volume up-and-down</h4>

<H2>WORKING: </H2>
  <h3>The actual working of the mouse is based on the Hand Landmarks which can be viewed and controlled by opencv and mediapipe.</h3>
  <h3>Our hand contains a total of 21 landmarks.</h3>

<h3>Based on distance between these landmarks, status of fingers as to whether it is closed or open is collected.</h3>
